# Blinkit-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
Analyzed Blinkitâ€™s sales data using Python to identify top-selling items, sales trends by outlet type, size, and year. Used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data cleaning, grouping, and visualization.
In this project, I analyzed Blinkit's sales and customer behavior data using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis focused on understanding product-wise sales performance, outlet distribution by location and size, and yearly trends. Visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and line plots were used to uncover key insights, helping identify top-performing item types, fat content preferences, and regional sales patterns. This project provided actionable business insights and improved data-driven decision-making for operations and marketing strategy.
